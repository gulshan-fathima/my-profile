    	<h2>My interests</h2>
    	<p>One of my bigeest and most passionate interests is learning about the art of filmmaking. Knowing what it takes to write a story and bringing that world into life through a thriving spirit of team work is truly fascinating. Moreover, going back and looking at some cinematic classics and learning about the meanings and the work that went into each of its scenes will make you fall in love with them all over again.
